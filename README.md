## Dat's porfolio website
This website is built with the following goals in mind:

* Taking advantages of latest web dev stack. (`create-react-app`, `graphql`)
* Minimize amount of dependencies. That means I can deploy this app anywhere.
* Flexible and scalable as much as possible.
* Using CRUD model, rather than static single-page.
